### Assignment 1:
- This assignment was completed in class, following instructions from Dr. Kashuk.
- We ran through spatial data wrangling, spatial autocorrelation measurements with Moran's I, Local Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA)

### Assignment 2:
- For this assignment I divided the Citibike rides data into seasons to compare (winter and summer)
- For each season I reproduced the steps of Assignment 1

Results:
- Winter Moran's I = 0.660
- Summer Moran's I = 0.629

- After this analysis we can see that for winter the Moran's I value is higher than for summer, indicating a higher spatial autocorrelation, meaning that hotspots are closer to each other than in summer. Analysing it in a practical way, we can guess that probably in winter less areas are 'explored' by riders, keeping the ride places more closer to each other, increasing the autocorrelation.

It is important to mention that the Mora's I difference is not so high (about 0.3)
