Homework 5:

Assignment 1:
- For this assignment I choose KS test to check if the distribution of the data by age follow a normal and poisson distributions,
and AD test to verify the proximity to normal and exponential distributions.
- The results obtained are that the age distribution is not close to any distributions teste (Normal, Poisson, Exponential).

Assignment 2:
- I followed the instructions of the skeleton notebook provided by Dr. Bianco.
- I worked as a group in this assignment with Victor Sette, Fernando Melchor and Kristi Korsberg.
- Plot scatter matrix by myself
- Plot the man total media income x women total media income divided by race
- Fit the points on a linear regression and find out a model to predict the women salary based on men salary.

Assignment 3:
Created a notebook with the hypothesis created based on given idea and information.

Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

Here is a brief resume of the notebook created as Homework_5_assignment_3.ipynb

1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
- Assuming Test and control sample have the same habits and similar health conditions, the Null Hypothesis is:
- People that exercise and don't diet (keep the previous regular eating habits) lose same or more % of fat that 
those who diets (change eating habits to a diet focused on losing fat) and don't exercise. Significance level p = 0.05.
- Alternative Hypothesis:
People within the experimental setup who diet and don't exercise lose signifficantly more % of 
fat that those who exercise but don't diet.
2. Do American trust the president?
- The Null Hypothesis is:
American Poll Surveyed peole who said 'no' (don't trust) is more or equal to American Survered people who said 'yes' 
(trust). Significance level p=0.05
- Alternative Hypothesis:
American Poll Surveyed peole who said 'yes' (trust) is signifficantly higher than American Survered people who said 'no' (don't trust).
3. Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
- The Null Hypothesis is:
The cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use placebo patch is higher or equal to cessation 
rates for smokers randomly assigned to use nicotine patch. Significance level p=0.05
- The Alternative Hypothesis is:
The cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use nicotine patch is signifficantly higher than cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use placebo patch.
4. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
- The Null Hypothesis is:
The mean of measured IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3 and 4 born from smoker mothers is higher or equal to children at same ages born from non smoker mothers. Significance level p = 0.05
- The Alternative Hypothesis is:
The mean of measured IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3 and 4 born from non smoker mothers is signifficantly higher than children at same ages born from smoker mothers.
