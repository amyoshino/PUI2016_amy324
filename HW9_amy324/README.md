Assignment 1 (only assignment)

Task 1:
- For this task I started the analysis loading MTA data and creating some variables to collapse Rides and Stations
- The first analysis is about event detection which we could find Hurricane Sandy as the firs event detected as it made the rides go more than 3 standart deviations away from the mean
- Excluding this outlier (Sandy), we could find another interesting event - NYC 2010 Bizzard

Task 2:
- On this task we find out wich ridership types is stationary or not, of those who are not stationary, we found out wich one is increasing and wich one is decreasing.
- I plotted out the number of rides x timeframe for each type of ridership
- I found out that: The type of ridership that increased more is Senior Citizen / Disabled and The type of ridership that decreased more is Monthly

Task 3:
- Here the idea here is to find the highest powers on the 4th period (48.5 weeks), as it is the closest to 52 weeks. To do that, let's create a threshold and the stations that are over this threshold will be printed.
- The highest 4 "powers" are found on stations [32, 150, 194, 327]
- We noticed the clear yearly pattern on each of those stations
- I had help on this task from Fernando Melchor (lmf445)
