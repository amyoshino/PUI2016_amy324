Adriano Yoshino comments on Homework 3 working proccess

Assignment 1:
- Done by myself inspired on DR. Bianco's code.
- Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Chi-Square ad Logistic distributions were choosen to this exercise
 
Assignment 2:
- The file choose was from March, 2015 
- IDEA: Customers are less likely than Subscribers to choose biking on weekdays
- NULL HYPOTHESIS: The ratio of Subscribers biking on weekends over Subscribers biking on weekdays is the same or
higher than the ratio of Customers biking over weekends to Customers biking on weekdays
- By seeing the plot, we can find out that our idea is pretty much true.

Assignment 3:
- Based on information obtained on last class, we have the old rout mean and standart deviation values.
- We calculated the mean and std to the new route and calculated z
- Hour test reject the null hypothesis.
