Adriano Yoshino comments on Homework 3 working proccess

Assignment 1:
- Done by myself inspired on DR. Bianco's code.
- Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Chi-Square ad Logistic distributions were choosen to this exercise
 
Assignment 2:
- The file choose was from March, 2015 
- IDEA: Customers are less likely than Subscribers to choose biking on weekdays
- NULL HYPOTHESIS: The ratio of Subscribers biking on weekends over Subscribers biking on weekdays is the same or
higher than the ratio of Customers biking over weekends to Customers biking on weekdays
- By seeing the plot, we can find out that our idea is pretty much true.

Assignment 3:
- Based on information obtained on last class, we have the old rout mean and standart deviation values.
- We calculated the mean and std to the new route and calculated z
- The idea is: Does this new route improved the commute time?
- Null Hypothesis: The commute time is longer or same comparing to the previous route, i.e., mean_time_new >= mean_time_old
- Alternative Hypothesis: The commute time is shorter compared to the old route. mean_time_new < mean_time_old
- Hour test reject the null hypothesis.

Observation: Since the deadline is moved to 23:59, I made some improvements on this homework. If not allowed, please use the 5pm version.
