Adriano Yoshino comments on Homework 4 working proccess

Assignment 1:
- Forked yc2839 repo and add a CitibikeReview_amy324 markdown 
- I found out that the idea and null Hypothesis were not perfect and I suggest some adjustments.
- Also the data was clear to do tests and I suggested a z-test, as yc2839 want to compare difference of trip duration between two
groups (1st half and 2nd half of the month).

Assignment 2:
- For this assignment I worked with Fernando Melchor (lmf445), and we choose two articles. One using ANCOVA method and another using COrrelation method. The result is on table below:
