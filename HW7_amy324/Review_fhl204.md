Plot Review by fhl204

Hi Yoshino,

Very interesting graph.  Just a few notes and suggestions below:  

CLARITY:  The caption below the graphs was very helpful.  Everything is also properly labeled (title, axis, legend, etc.).  
As as a suggestion, I would rephrase the title as "Top 10 Districts with Gender Income Inequality in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil" and maybe 
adding whether the salary is yearly or monthly.
In the caption, a brief description of of how you arrived at the top 10 would provide better clarity.  Also not sure if you meant 
to have a different max for the x and y axis.  It would be my preference to see the blue line run diagnally across from corner to corner.
If that was by intent, please explain in the caption.

ESTHETIC: I like the colors and labels.  The marks are a bit small and I recognize that there are two outliers.  I'm curious
to see if it would make much of the difference to your case if you omit them.  By omitting the outliners, you can zoom in on the cluster
a bit better.  This might also allow you to add another dimesion to the graph by changing the size of the markers based on another
variable (i.e. % of the workforce).

HONESTY: Very much enjoyed reviewing this. It's a very interesting dataset; excellent work making the case for inequality.

Thanks!
